This is a buttom-up proteomics pipeline to automatically process the hemoglobin variants from HbVar and Ithanet databases. The output is a list of unique peptides for each variant, these peptides are unique not only to other variants, but also unique to the entire human proteome. 

These peptides are theoretically trypsin cleaved with minimum 7 amino acids, if shorter than 7, miss cleavage will be introduced.
