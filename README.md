This is a buttom-up proteomics pipeline to process the hemoglobin variants amino acids from HbVar and Ithanet databases and return a list of unique peptides for each variant. The returned peptides are unique to other variants and the entire human proteome. 

These peptides are theoretically trypsin cleaved with minimum 7 amino acids, if shorter than 7, miss cleavage will be introduced.
